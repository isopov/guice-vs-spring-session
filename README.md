This project is simple illustration to the fact that guice does support circular dependencies in session beans and spring does not. To launch I use run-jetty0run plugin for Eclipse. In this case the urls are:
http://localhost:8080/guice-vs-spring-session/spring/hello
http://localhost:8080/guice-vs-spring-session/guice/hello
